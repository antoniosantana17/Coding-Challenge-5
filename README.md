# Coding-Challenge-5

This JavaScript project expands manager capability by managing staff salary and bonus computations. The Employee class is the first one created, and it has attributes for the name, monthly pay, and yearly salary calculation method. When an Employee object is instantiated, the name and monthly wage are logged. A Manager subclass that descends from Employee adds an additional department property and an override for the annual pay computation to include a 15% bonus. Both the overall yearly salary and bonus amount are recorded. This is shown in the project using two Manager examples: Debbie Little from Finance, making $7205.00 per month, and Bob Ross from Digital Marketing, earning $6600.00. They compute and track their yearly pay, which includes bonuses. This demonstrates the program's ability to manage various jobs and pay scales effectively.
